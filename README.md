and [other](http://citationstyles.org/) reference managers.

Should follow KAK [sitation rules]
(http://www.taloustieteellinenyhdistys.fi/kansantaloudellinen-aikakauskirja/ohjeita-kirjoittajille/) for most used publication types.

Please report problems.

Note that there is a problem with working papers and reports. 
In cls working papers should be filed as reports. 
The KAK, however, has a different formating rules for 
working papers and book-like reports. 
The issue is solved by using the working
paper formating for reports when the Report type (Raportin tyyppi) 
field is not empty. (Usually filed with term: working paper or discussion paper)
Otherwise the book-like report formating is used for reports.
